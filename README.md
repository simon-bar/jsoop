# jsOOP
Lightweight yet capable OOP framework for JavaScript

This repository contains a very neat piece of code that simplifies and enhances JavaScript built-in Object-Oriented Programming mechanisms.

In contrast to other similar libraries, `jsOOP` operates directly on regular functions without introducing any special "Class" function that has to be used in order to benefit from the library's goodness. This means that `jsOOP` can be applied to some existing codebase with lots of classes (or `functions` to be exact), allowing for creating new classes inheriting from the existing ones.

To have a quick overview of `jsOOP`'s features, please have a look at [tests](tests/tests.html) just for now - I will provide some more documentation soon.
